		</header><h3 id="the-difference-between-readonly-and-const">The Difference Between Readonly and Const</h3>
<p>The difference between the <code>const</code> modifier and the <code>readonly</code> modifier is that a field declared <code>const</code> has to be fully evaluable at compile time, where as a field declared <code>readonly</code> is evaluated at runtime. In addition, a read-only field can be assigned in a constructor or in the initialiser of that field. Constants must be value types but read-only fields can be either value or reference types - declaring a read-only reference field does not make the object that the field refers to immutable, it only makes the reference itself immutable.</p>
