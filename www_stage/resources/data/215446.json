However, the Windows API abstracts NTFS to make it appear as though it is case insensitive. For example, if you had myfile.txt already in a directory, Windows would not allow you to make a file called MyFile.TXT in that directory or move one in there without renaming it or replacing the original.\n\nThis matters to .NET Core developers working on Linux because Windows contributors to a git repository will have all sorts of issues with same name but different case files (you can actually enable a feature in developer mode to deal with this issue [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/354220/how-to-enable-case-sensitive-folders-on-windows-10/) if you run into this issue).
