			<h1>.NET Fun Facts</h1>
			<p>A selection of 'fun facts' and useful tidbits of information that I have compiled about C#, the .NET Framework, and surrounding tools developed by both Microsoft and other organisations.</p>
		</header><h3 id="null-confusion">Null Confusion</h3>
<p>Null can be confusing, so here is a metaphor that hopefully makes it a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Imagine that you work in a hotel with lots of difference rooms. You have to distribute a load of parcels that have pieces of paper attached to them. If the piece of paper is blank, that doesn&#39;t mean that the piece of paper doesn&#39;t exist, or that none of the rooms exist, it just means that you can&#39;t deliver the parcel.</p>
<p>A reference is like a piece of paper, and a parcel is like a message that is sent to an object - the piece of paper <em>can</em> have a room number written on it, but it doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to, and the parcel needs to arrive somewhere in order to be delivered. The .NET Framework &#39;knows&#39; that it has to throw a NullReferenceException when you try to &#39;use&#39; a &#39;null object&#39;, because the message that you send doesn&#39;t arrive anywhere.</p>
