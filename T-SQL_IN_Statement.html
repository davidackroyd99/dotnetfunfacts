			<h1>.NET Fun Facts</h1>
			<p>A selection of 'fun facts' and useful tidbits of information that I have compiled about C#, the .NET Framework, and surrounding tools developed by both Microsoft and other organisations.</p>
		</header><h3 id="t-sql-in-statement">T-SQL IN Statement</h3>
<p>In T-SQL you can use the <code>IN</code> statement in a <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter results by a list or subquery.</p>
<p>The following query selects all employees with any of the job titles in the list.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Title IN (&#39;Software Engineer&#39;, &#39;Support Technician&#39;, &#39;Project Manager&#39;)
</code></pre><p>The following query finds all of the employees who work in any of the offices in Plymouth. </p>
<pre><code>SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE OfficeName IN (Select OfficeName FROM Offices WHERE Location = &#39;Plymouth&#39;)
</code></pre><p>Subqueries with IN may be more readable than using multiple joins and they can help when writing a quick query to get some data but they often have performance issues so if you are building them into an application make sure to optimise them.</p>
